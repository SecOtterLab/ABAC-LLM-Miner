Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to fix the current rules to eliminate over-permissions while ensuring all required permissions are granted. The main issues are:

1. Rules are too broad, granting access across wards/teams inappropriately
2. Missing specific constraints for team membership and ward assignments
3. Need to add constraints to limit cross-ward access

Here are the corrected ABAC rules:

rule(position [ {doctor}, teams ] treatingTeam; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; )
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {doctor}, specialties ] topics; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; )
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; author = uid)
rule(agentFor ] patient; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; )
rule(agentFor ] patient; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; )
rule(uid = patient; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; )
rule(uid = patient; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; )
