Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to fix the current rules to eliminate the 7 over-permissions while maintaining all correct permissions. The over-permissions are all related to nurses reading nursing items across different wards.

The issue is with the first rule:
```
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics ] nursing; {read}; ward = ward)
```

This rule allows any nurse to read any nursing item as long as the nurse's ward matches the item's ward. However, the ground truth shows that nurses should only read nursing items from patients in their own ward, not nursing items they authored in other wards.

I need to replace this overly permissive rule with specific rules that match the exact permissions in the ground truth ACL.
