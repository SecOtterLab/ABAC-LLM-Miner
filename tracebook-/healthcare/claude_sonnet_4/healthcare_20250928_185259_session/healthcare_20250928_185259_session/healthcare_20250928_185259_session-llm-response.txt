Looking at the ACL comparison, I can see that the current rules are granting too many permissions (46 over-permissions). The main issues are:

1. The doctor rule is too broad - it allows all doctors to read all HRitems in their specialties, but should be restricted to their treating teams
2. The nurse rule allows reading all nursing items in their ward, but should be more restrictive
3. Patient and agent rules are too broad - they're reading all items when they should only read specific types

Let me fix these rules:

rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; specialties > topics, teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; uid = author)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; agentFor ] patient)
