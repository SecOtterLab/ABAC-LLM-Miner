Looking at the GROUND_TRUTH_ACL, I need to analyze the access patterns to create minimal ABAC rules that grant exactly the same permissions.

Let me identify the key patterns:
1. Doctors can read HRitems in their specialties and add items to HRs for patients on their teams
2. Nurses can read nursing items and add items to HRs for patients in their ward
3. Patients can read their own note items and add notes to their own HRs
4. Agents can read note items and add notes to HRs for patients they represent
5. Authors can read HRitems they created

Here are the ABAC rules:

rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; specialties > topics)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; uid = author)

rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; uid = author)

Looking at the ACL comparison, I can see that the current rules are granting too many permissions (46 over-permissions). The main issues are:

1. The doctor rule is too broad - it allows all doctors to read all HRitems in their specialties, but should be restricted to their treating teams
2. The nurse rule allows reading all nursing items in their ward, but should be more restrictive
3. Patient and agent rules are too broad - they're reading all items when they should only read specific types

Let me fix these rules:

rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; specialties > topics, teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; uid = author)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; agentFor ] patient)
=====================*****************MINOR FORMATTING***********************======================
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; specialties > topics, teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HRitem}; {read}; uid = author)
rule(position [ {doctor}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; teams ] treatingTeam)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {nursing}; {read}; ward = ward)
rule(position [ {nurse}; type [ {HR}; {addItem}; ward = ward)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; uid = patient)
rule(; type [ {HRitem}, topics [ {note}; {read}; agentFor ] patient)
rule(; type [ {HR}; {addNote}; agentFor ] patient)
