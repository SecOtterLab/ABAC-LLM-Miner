Looking at the ACL comparison, I can see that the current rules have two main issues:

1. **Over permissions**: Accountants and auditors are getting read access to budgets, which they shouldn't have according to the ground truth ACL
2. **Under permissions**: All the technical workers (designers and coders) and project leaders are missing their permissions entirely

Let me fix these issues by correcting the problematic rules and ensuring all required permissions are covered:

rule(adminRoles ] accountant; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(adminRoles ] auditor; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(adminRoles ] planner; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(adminRoles ] manager; type [ {budget schedule}; {read write}; department = department)
rule(projectsLed ] project; type [ {budget schedule}; {read write}; )
rule(expertise ] expertise, isEmployee [ {True}; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {True}; {read request setStatus}; projects ] project, tasks ] rid)
rule(expertise ] expertise; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {False}; {read request setStatus}; projects ] project, tasks ] rid)
rule(expertise ] expertise, isEmployee [ {True}; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {True}; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] expertise; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {False}; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(projects ] project; type [ {schedule}; {read}; )
