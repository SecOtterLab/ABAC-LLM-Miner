Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to fix the current rules to eliminate over-permissions and add the missing under-permissions. The main issues are:

1. Current rules grant too broad access to tasks (allowing cross-expertise access)
2. Missing specific permissions for technical workers to access schedules
3. Missing setStatus permissions for assigned tasks
4. Missing leader access to budgets and schedules

Here are the corrected ABAC rules:

rule(adminRoles ] accountant; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(adminRoles ] auditor; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(adminRoles ] planner; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(projectsLed ] project; type [ {budget schedule}; {read write}; )
rule(projects ] project, projectsLed ] project; type [ {schedule}; {read}; )
rule(expertise ] design; type [ {task}, expertise ] design; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] coding; type [ {task}, expertise ] coding; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] design, isEmployee [ {True}; type [ {task}, expertise ] design, proprietary [ {True}; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] coding, isEmployee [ {True}; type [ {task}, expertise ] coding, proprietary [ {True}; {read request}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] design; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(expertise ] coding; type [ {schedule}; {read}; projects ] project)
rule(isEmployee [ {True}; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {True}; {setStatus}; tasks ] rid)
rule(isEmployee [ {False}; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {True}; {setStatus}; tasks ] rid)
rule(; type [ {task}, proprietary [ {False}; {setStatus}; tasks ] rid)
