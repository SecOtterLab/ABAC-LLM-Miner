Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to fix the current rules to include the missing permissions (under permissions). The issue is that the current rules are missing access for faculty to their course gradebooks and rosters, department chairs to student transcripts in their department, and TAs to gradebooks for courses they teach.

Let me analyze the missing permissions:
- Faculty need access to gradebooks for courses they teach
- Department chairs need access to transcripts of students in their department  
- TAs (students who teach courses) need access to gradebooks for courses they teach
- Faculty need access to rosters for courses they teach

Here are the corrected ABAC rules:

rule(position [ {student}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; )
rule(position [ {faculty}, isChair [ {True}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; department ] departments)
rule(position [ {student}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {applicant}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {admissions}; type [ {application}; {read setStatus}; )
rule(position [ {student}, crsTaught ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {readScore addScore}; )
rule(position [ {student}; type [ {gradebook}; {readMyScores}; crsTaken ] crs)
rule(position [ {faculty}, crsTaught ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {readScore assignGrade changeScore addScore}; )
rule(position [ {faculty}, crsTaught ] crs; type [ {roster}; {read}; )
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {roster}; {read write}; )
