Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to add rules to cover the 34 under-permissions (missing permissions) in the current rule set. These are primarily:

1. Chair access to transcripts in their department
2. Student access to gradebooks for courses they've taken (readMyScores) and courses they TA (readScore, addScore)

Let me analyze and fix the rules:

rule(position [ {student}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; )
rule(isChair [ {True}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; department ] departments)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {admissions}; type [ {application}; {read setStatus}; )
rule(position [ {student}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {applicant}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {faculty}; type [ {gradebook}; {assignGrade changeScore addScore readScore}; crsTaught ] crs)
rule(position [ {student}, crsTaught ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {readScore addScore}; )
rule(position [ {student}, crsTaken ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {readMyScores}; )
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {roster}; {read write}; )
rule(position [ {faculty}; type [ {roster}; {read}; crsTaught ] crs)
