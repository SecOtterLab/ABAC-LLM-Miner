Looking at the ACL comparison, I need to add 34 missing permissions to the current rules. The missing permissions fall into these categories:

1. Department chairs reading transcripts in their department
2. Students with TA roles (crsTaught) accessing gradebooks for courses they TA
3. Students reading their own scores in courses they've taken

Let me analyze the missing permissions and fix the rules:

rule(position [ {student}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; )
rule(isChair [ {True}; type [ {transcript}; {read}; department = departments)
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {admissions}; type [ {application}; {read setStatus}; )
rule(position [ {student}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {applicant}; type [ {application}; {checkStatus}; uid = student)
rule(position [ {faculty}; type [ {gradebook}; {assignGrade changeScore addScore readScore}; crsTaught ] crs)
rule(position [ {student}, crsTaught ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {addScore readScore}; )
rule(position [ {student}, crsTaken ] crs; type [ {gradebook}; {readMyScores}; )
rule(position [ {staff}, department [ {registrar}; type [ {roster}; {read write}; )
rule(position [ {faculty}; type [ {roster}; {read}; crsTaught ] crs)
